# Collaborative Filtering Recommender System to Predict Movie Ratings

This repository implements a collaborative filtering (CF) recommender system to predict movie ratings for users. The system leverages user-item interaction data to recommend movies similar to those enjoyed by users with similar taste. 

I have completed this project while completing my Coursera specialization called "[Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/NG3GPTVN7M8E?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=s12n)"

### Key Features

- Predicts movie ratings based on user-movie rating history.
- Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques (potentially user-based or item-based).
- Offers recommendations for users based on their past preferences and similar users' ratings.

### Dataset

The Dataset used for building the Recommender System is derived from [MovieLens "ml_dataset_small" dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) which contains **9000 movies** and **600 users**.

### Evaluation

The system may include evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy of the predictions, such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Contribution

We welcome contributions to improve this recommender system. Feel free to submit pull requests with bug fixes, enhancements, or new features.
